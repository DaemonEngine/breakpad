// simple_symbol_supplier.h: A simple SymbolSupplier implementation
//
// SimpleSymbolSupplier is a straightforward implementation of SymbolSupplier
// that stores symbol files in a filesystem tree.  A SimpleSymbolSupplier is
// created with a base directory, which is the root for all symbol files.
// Each symbol file contained therien has a directory entry in the base
// directory with a name identical to the corresponding pdb file.  Within
// each of these directories, there are subdirectories named for the uuid and
// age of each pdb file.  The uuid is presented in hexadecimal form, with
// uppercase characters and no dashes.  The age is appended to it in decimal
// form, without any separators.  Within that subdirectory,
// SimpleSymbolSupplier expects to find the symbol file, which is named
// identically to the pdb file, but with a .sym extension.  This sample
// hierarchy is rooted at the "symbols" base directory:
//
// symbols
// symbols/test_app.pdb
// symbols/test_app.pdb/63FE4780728D49379B9D7BB6460CB42A1
// symbols/test_app.pdb/63FE4780728D49379B9D7BB6460CB42A1/test_app.sym
// symbols/kernel32.pdb
// symbols/kernel32.pdb/BCE8785C57B44245A669896B6A19B9542
// symbols/kernel32.pdb/BCE8785C57B44245A669896B6A19B9542/kernel32.sym
//
// In this case, the uuid of test_app.pdb is
// 63fe4780-728d-4937-9b9d-7bb6460cb42a and its age is 1.
//
// This scheme was chosen to be roughly analogous to the way that
// symbol files may be accessed from Microsoft Symbol Server.  A hierarchy
// used for Microsoft Symbol Server storage is usable as a hierarchy for
// SimpleSymbolServer, provided that the pdb files are transformed to dumped
// format using a tool such as dump_syms, and given a .sym extension.
//
// TODO(mmentovai): verify that MSSS stores the age as presented as decimal
// and not hexadecimal or something else.  Adjust here to match if necessary.
//
// SimpleSymbolSupplier presently only supports symbol files that have
// the MSVC 7.0 CodeView record format.  See MDCVInfoPDB70 in
// minidump_format.h.
