  // copying the stack pointer (%esp) to the frame pointer (%ebp).  Therefore,
  // the calling procedure's frame pointer is always available by
  // dereferencing the called procedure's frame pointer, and the return
  // address is always available at the memory location immediately above
  // the address pointed to by the called procedure's frame pointer.

  // If there is no frame pointer, determining the layout of the stack is
  // considerably more difficult, requiring debugging information.  This
  // stackwalker doesn't attempt to solve that problem (at this point).
