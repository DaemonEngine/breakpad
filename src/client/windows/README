This directory contains client code for collecting and sending minidumps.
You can use them in your project as follows:

exception_handler.lib:

This library should be linked into the application from which you want
to collect crash reports.  See the comments in exception_handler.h for
instructions on setting up the handler to write minidumps on crash.
You can also use ExceptionHandler to write non-crash minidumps.

When linking with this static library, you will need to also link with
rpcrt4.lib and ole32.lib.

crash_report_sender.lib:

Typically, after catching a crash, you will launch an external application
to collect any additional information from the user, and upload the report to
the server.  CrashReportSender is a utility class that can be used when the
data is ready to upload.

When linking with this static library, you will need to also link with
wininet.lib.
